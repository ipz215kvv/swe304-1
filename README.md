## **ðŸ§³ Migrating from Maven to Gradle**

When you pull the commit replacing Maven with Gradle, follow these steps to migrate the project:

1. **Remove Maven-specific files**

   Delete the `pom.xml`, `mvnw`, `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd` files, and `.mvn/` folder, as Gradle will no longer use it.

2. **Refresh dependencies**

    Your first build execution need to refresh newly added dependencies:

    ```bash
    gradle build --refresh-dependencies
    ```
