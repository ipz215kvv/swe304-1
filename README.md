# **SWE 304 Group Project - 1**  

## **ðŸ›  Prerequisites**  

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java 17** ([Download](https://adoptium.net/))
- **Maven** ([Install Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
- **MySQL Server** ([Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/))


## **ðŸ“‚ Installation**  

1. **Clone the repository**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ipz215kvv/swe304-1.git
    cd swe304-1
    ```

2. **`.env` file**  
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with variables like showed in [example](.env.example).

3. **Create database locally**  
    If MySQL is installed locally, create the database manually, all required tables will be generated automatically:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE swe304;
    ```


## **ðŸš€ Build & Run the Project**  

1. **Build the `.jar` file**  
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
    For more info go to: [Maven Build Process](#maven-build-process)

2. **Run the application**  
    ```bash
    java -jar target/swe304_1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8000
    ```

3. **Access the Web App**  
    Once running, open your browser and go to:  
    ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


## **Maven Build Process**

The command `mvn clean package` is a combination of two important Maven lifecycle phases: `clean` and `package`. Hereâ€™s how each part works:

### 1. `mvn clean`
The `clean` phase removes any files generated by previous builds. When you run this command, Maven deletes the `target` directory, which contains compiled classes, JAR files, and other build artifacts. This ensures that you start with a clean slate for your next build.

### 2. `mvn package`
The `package` phase compiles your code and packages it into a distributable format (like a JAR or WAR file). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens during this phase:

- **validate**: Checks if the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
- **compile**: Compiles the source code of the project.
- **test**: Runs tests using a suitable testing framework (like JUnit). If any tests fail, the build will stop.
- **package**: Takes the compiled code and packages it into a JAR, WAR, or other specified format, as defined in the `pom.xml` file.

### Combined Execution
When you run `mvn clean package`, Maven first executes the `clean` phase to remove the `target` directory, and then it proceeds to the `package` phase, which includes the steps mentioned above. This ensures that you are working with the latest code and that any previous artifacts do not interfere with the current build.

### Running Individual Commands
You can run each of these phases and goals individually without executing the entire `mvn package` command. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

1. **Validate**:

    ```bash
    mvn validate
    ```

2. **Compile**:

    ```bash
    mvn compile
    ```

3. **Test**:

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

4. **Package**:

    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```
